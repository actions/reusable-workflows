# This workflow helps us to be sure that generated innards of `dist` directory actually match what we expect them to be.
# The `dist` is a special directory in Actions.
# When you reference an action with `uses:` in a workflow, javascript files from `dist` will run.
# In Actions, we generate the dist through a build process from other source files.
